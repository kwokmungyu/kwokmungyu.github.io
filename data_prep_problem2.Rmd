## Data Preprocessing

This page shows how the data used in the `problem_2.rmd` dashboard was loaded and cleaned.

### 1. Load Required Packages

First, we load all R packages necessary for analysis and plotting.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(flexdashboard)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(stringr) # For str_c
library(forcats) # For fct_reorder
```
